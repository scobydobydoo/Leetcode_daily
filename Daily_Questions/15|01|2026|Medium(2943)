🟦 Maximum Area of Square Hole in a Grid


🧩 Problem Statement

You are given two integers n and m, and two integer arrays hBars and vBars.

The grid has n + 2 horizontal bars and m + 2 vertical bars.

These bars form 1 × 1 unit cells.

Bars are indexed starting from 1.

You may remove some bars listed in hBars and vBars.

All other bars are fixed and cannot be removed.

Return the maximum area of a square-shaped hole that can be formed after removing some bars (possibly none).


🧠 Intuition

Removing consecutive bars merges adjacent rows or columns into a larger continuous gap.

If k consecutive horizontal bars are removed → height becomes k + 1

If k consecutive vertical bars are removed → width becomes k + 1

To form a square hole, height and width must be equal.
So we find the largest consecutive sequence of removed horizontal and vertical bars and take the minimum of the two.


🛠️ Approach

Sort both hBars and vBars.

Find the longest consecutive sequence in each array.

Convert bar count to cell size by adding 1.

Take the minimum of horizontal and vertical sizes.

Return the square of the side length.



⏱️ Complexity

Time: O(H log H + V log V)

Space: O(1)


# Code
```python []
class Solution(object):
    def maximizeSquareHoleArea(self, n, m, hBars, vBars):
        hBars.sort()
        vBars.sort()

        def longest (arr):
            mxx=curr=1
            for i in range(1,len(arr)):
                if arr[i] == arr[i-1] + 1:
                    curr +=1
                else :
                    curr =1 
                mxx=max(mxx, curr)
            return mxx
        sides= min(longest(hBars) + 1, longest(vBars) + 1)
        return sides*sides
```
